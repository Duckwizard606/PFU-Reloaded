EVTNAME202000;The Five Days of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202000;Milan, capital of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia and our most important foothold in Italy is occupied by rebells! Italian patriots have observed the ongoing unrest in our country and drove our garrisons out of the city. Popular uprisings are spreading in our Italian depencies, building barricades, raising flags with the Italian tricolore, and shouting their battle-cry for an unified Italy. After five days, the last Austrian soldier had to draw back. Our men fought bravely, but we had no chance - these rude traitors are now in complete control of the capital of Lombardy, celebrating these 'Five Days of Milan'. This may be the beginning of a dangerous turn in our Italian politics!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA202000;Send Radetzky!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202001;A Sardinian Intervention?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202001;In $YEAR$ revolutionary riots broke out in numerous places of Italy, as well in many other parts of Europe. Charles Albert in Piedmont  had been forced to make concessions to the democrats. With Vienna itself in revolt, both Milan  and Venice, the main cities of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, under Austrian rule, revolted. The situation was favorable for Sardinia, which would see the full support of the lombard patriots in Milan, if they intervened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202002;The Italian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202002;In $YEAR$ revolutionary riots broke out in numerous places of Italy, as well in many other parts of Europe. Charles Albert in Piedmont  had been forced to make concessions to the democrats. With Vienna itself in revolt, both Milan  and Venice, the main cities of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, under Austrian rule, revolted. The situation was favorable for Sardinia, which would see the full support of the lombard patriots in Milan. The Kingdom decided to exploit the moment, and attacked the weakened Austria in her Italian possessions. After a plebiscite, Milan was annexed by Sardinia, and a combined army beat the Austrians at Pastrengo. The War of Italian Independence had begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202003;The Fall of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202003;The Fall of Milan was a huge blow to the Piedmontese army. The way to Turin lay open, Austrian forces had been reorganized and had rotted most of our armies. Sardinia is in a very delicate situation, and the total collapse of the country was imminent if the Austrians pressed their advance. The King, Charles Albert, has proposed that he abdicate the throne and return the provinces in Lombardy to Austria, in return for the return to the status quo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202004;Austria Wins the Italian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202004;The Piedmontese ambitions have ended in a crushing defeat. The King of Sardinia has abdicated, Milan returned under rightful Austrian rule, and peace has been restored. The failure of nationalistic forces has been a huge setback for any potential union of Italian states. This is a glorious day for Austria!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202005;The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202005;A delegation of Italian nationalists, led by a man called Daniele Manin, has petitioned the congregation of Venetia regarding a 'Constitution', 'Independence of the Italian Kingdom' and other, trivial matters, regarding liberalism and democracy. Such ideas are rising in the Italian provinces. Cultural life in Milan and Venetia is full of propaganda against the government, and it seems, that Italian insolence has reached a new peak.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202006;Repubblica di San Marco;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202006;After existing as an independent maritime republic for 100 years and a leading naval power in the Mediterranean for most of that time, the Republic of Venice surrendered to Napoleon during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1797 and was ceded to the Austrian Empire (as the kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia) by the Treaty of Campo Formio a few months later. Austrian rule, after realising that mutually-agreeable home rule would not be possible, exploited Venetian resources, economically and politically, favouring Trieste as the imperial seaport. Within 50 years of their acquisition of the former republic, Austria had taken 45 million Austrian lire more from the region than had been spent there and Venetian capitalism had been stifled by a reluctance on the part of the slow, bureaucratic Habsburg régime to grant credit to Venetian entrepreneurs. In the chaos of the springtime of nations,  Daniele Manin entered the Venetian Arsenal with 'a number of public-spirited Venetians', in a direct challenge to Austrian rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202007;The Serenissima is Back;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202007;After 50 years of occupation, of humilation and ignorance, the day of salvation has come. The streets are filled with weeping old people, which saw the gonfalon, the banner with the winged lion in their days of youth, and now - once again - see him shining in the sun of a new future. The songs of our fathers are sung again, and the cry 'Viva San Marco!' is not prohibited anymore.Long live Venice, long live Saint Mark, long live the glory of our lion. Our patronsaint has rescued us, he didn't forget his own people - Venice, our beloved home, is free!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202008;Italian or Venetian?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202008;After the succesful War of Independence, one topic is present in every tavern: the future of Venice. Some want to be unified with Sardinia, becoming later a part of a new united Italian state. Others are more cautios, willing to wait until this new state evolves and the day of decision has come. A last group isn't willing to join any state, underlining, that Venice was and will be independent forever, as it was before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202019;Sardinia Wins the Italian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202019;This is a great day for nationalists, patriots and all opressed people in the world. The Italian people have won an important victory against Austria. Lombardy is now free from Habsburg oppression and is now under rightful Italian rule, people in Milan and Turin are celebrating, and the nation will remember this day of glory. \n\nHowever, this is just the first step in the heroic strugle for the unification of Italy, we must now turn our eyes to the rest of the peninsula!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202020;The Status Quo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202020;Sardinia has made a White peace with us. We should claim Milan, because it is still occupied by foreign troops. The international scene will agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202021;We have made a White peace with Austria. We must return Milan, because it was under Austrian rule before the war. The international scene will be upset, if we don't.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202022;Sardinia remains stubborn;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202022;Sardinia doesn't return Milan - we must take it with force!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202024;Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202024;The smashing defeat has serious consequences on our country. The abdication of our king provokes unrest. Advisers propose a new approach in our politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202030;Inno delle nazioni;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202030;For a musical jubilee, which was part of the International Exhibition of $YEAR$, the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi prepared a cantata, called 'Inno delle nazione' (Hymn of the Nations), including  different hymns, representing three european countries: Great Britain (God save the King), France (La Marseillaise) and Italy (Fratelli d'Italia). The Inno delle nazione exalted the brotherhood of man, and became a huge success, when it was performed, making a lasting impression. This was not only true concerning Verdi's talent, but also true for the young nation state of Italy, which became a part of international affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202009;Giuseppe Mazzini;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202009;Giuseppe Mazzini, nicknamed 'The Beating Heart of Italy' was an Italian politician, journalist and activist for the unification of Italy. Mazzini was a member of the Carbonari, a secret association with political purposes. Later, he went to Marseille, where he became a popular figure to the other Italian exiles. He organized a new political society called La giovine Italia (Young Italy). Young Italy was a secret society formed to promote Italian unification. Mazzini believed that a popular uprising would create a unified Italy, and would touch off a European-wide revolutionary movement. Young Italy counted ca 60,000 adherents in 1833, with branches in Genoa and other cities. In that year Mazzini launched a first attempt of insurrection in Sardinia, which failed.  He organized another uprising for the following year. A group of Italian exiles were to enter Piedmont from Switzerland and spread the revolution there, and founded a new association with German and Polish refugees, called Young Europe. Austria and Sardinia put pressure on Switzerland to extradite Mazzini.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202014;Pius IX;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202014;The conclave of 1846, following the death of Pope Gregory XVI (183146), took place in an unsettled political climate within Italy. Because of this, many foreign Cardinals decided not to attend the conclave. At its start, only 46 out of 62 cardinals were present. Moreover, the conclave of 1846 was steeped in a factional division between conservatives and liberals. Faced with deadlock, liberals and moderates decided to cast their votes for Mastai-Ferretti in a move that contradicted the general mood throughout Europe. By the second day of the conclave, on 16 June 1846, during an evening ballot, Mastai-Ferretti was elected Pope.  As liberal Europe applauded his election, he introduced political reforms on a broad scale. For the next twenty months after the election, Pius IX was the most popular man on the Italian peninsula, where the exclamation 'Long life to Pius IX!' was often heard. His initial policies created quite a sensation among Italian patriots, both at home and in exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202015;The Roman Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202015;As a liberal and aware of the political pressures within the Papal States, his first act of a general amnesty for political prisoners did not consider its potential implications and consequences: The freed revolutionaries merely resumed their previous activities and his concessions only provoked greater demands as patriotic Italian groups sought not only a constitutional government, which he was sympathetic to, but also the Unification of Italy under his leadership and a war of liberation against Catholic Austria, which claimed the northern Italian provinces as its own. By early $YEAR$, all of Western Europe began to be convulsed in various revolutionary movements. The Pope, claiming to be above national interests, refused to go to war with Austria, which totally reversed the up to now popular view of him in his native Italy. In a calculated, well-prepared move, Rossi was assassinated on 15 November 1848, and in the days following, the Swiss Guards were disarmed, making the Pope a prisoner in his palace. A Roman Republic was declared.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202033;I Promessi Sposi;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202033;The Betrothed (orig. Italian: I Promessi Sposi) is an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, first published in 1827, in three volumes. Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years under Spanish rule, it is sometimes seen as a veiled attack on Austria, which controlled the region at the time the novel was written. I Promessi Sposi was the first Italian historical novel,  a model for subsequent Italian literary fiction and a basis for the modern Italian language. In the early 19th century, there was still some controversy as to what form the standard literary language of Italy should take. Manzoni - originally from Milan - was firmly in favour of the dialect of Florence and, after 'washing his vocabulary on the banks of the Arno' (as he put it), he revised the novel's language for its republication in 1842.  Many expressions, quotes and names from the novel are still commonly used in Italian, such as Perpetua (meaning a priest's house worker) or 'Questo matrimonio non s'ha da fare' ('This marriage is not to be performed', used ironically) and it is still considered a true masterpiece of world literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202035;Il Canto degli Italiani;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202035;Il Canto degli Italiani (The Song of the Italians) is best known among Italians as 'Inno di Mameli' (Mameli's Hymn), after the author of the lyrics, or 'Fratelli d'Italia' (Brothers of Italy), from its opening line. The words were written in $YEAR$ in Genoa, by the then 20-year-old student and patriot Goffredo Mameli, in a climate of popular struggle for unification and independence of Italy which foreshadowed the war against Austria. Two months later, they were set to music in Turin by another Genoese, Michele Novaro. The hymn enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the period of the Risorgimento and in the following decades. The hymn was also printed on leaflets in Genoa, by the printing office Casamara and published on the December 10: the demonstration was officially dedicated to the 101st anniversary of the expulsion of the Austrian powers from the city - in fact it was an excuse to protest against foreign occupations in Italy and induce Carlo Alberto to embrace the Italian cause of liberty. In this occasion the tricolor flag was shown and Mameli's hymn was publicly sung for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202038;The Legacy of Ugo Foscolo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202038;"When Italy conquered Rome, the new nation state antagonized the Papacy and was in a permament struggle with the Apostolic See. Italy favored secular movements and a new national spirit to encounter the strong catholic sentiment within the country, emulating the french state. Italian artists, philosophers or scientists were promoted, and Santa Croce in Florence became an equivalent to the Pantheon in Paris. Especially personalities with secular or atheistic views were important, like the famous Italian revolutionary and poet Ugo Foscolo. Foscolo, born on Zakynthos (the venetian Zante) in 1778 was an important figure in this new gallery of ""Secular Saints"", but unfortunately, Foscolo died in Chiswick, Western London, after eleven years of exile in England. In $YEAR$, Italy requested his remains.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202041;Foscolo returns!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202041;In $YEAR$, Foscolo's remains were brought to Florence, at the request of Italy, and with all the pride, pomp and circumstance of a great national mourning, found their final resting-place beside the monuments of Machiavelli and Alfieri, of Michelangelo and Galileo, in the church of Santa Croce, the pantheon of Italian glory he had celebrated in Dei sepolcri. Long live Italy, long live the United Kingdom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202042;First wireless transatlantic transmission;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202042;At the turn of the 20th century, the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began investigating the means to signal completely across the Atlantic, in order to compete with the transatlantic telegraph cables. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, Co. Wexford in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall and Clifden in Co. Galway. He soon made the announcement that on 12 December 1901, using a 152.4-metre (500 ft) kite-supported antenna for reception, the message was received at Signal Hill in St John's, Newfoundland (now part of Canada) signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. In $YEAR$, Marconi built a station near South Wellfleet, Massachusetts that sent a message of greetings from Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the United States, to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202045;La Mole Antoniellana;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202045;The Mole Antonelliana is a major landmark building in Turin. It is named for the architect who built it, Alessandro Antonelli. The building was conceived and constructed as a synagogue. The Jewish community of Turin - with a budget of 250,000 lire and the intention of having a building worthy of a capital city - hired Antonio Antonelli. Antonelli promised  to build a synagogue for 280,000 lire. The relationship between Antonelli and the Jewish community was not happy. He proposed a series of modifications which raised the height to 167 meters, over 46 meters higher than the dome in the original design. Such changes, in addition to greater costs and construction time than were originally anticipated, did not please the Jewish community and construction was halted in 1869, with a provisional roof. The people of Turin, who had watched the synagogue rise skyward, demanded that the city take over the project. The state considered to establish a museum dedicated to the Italian unification, reflecting the greatness of the Risorgimento - in one of the highest buildings of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202046;Macchi M.C.72;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202046;The Macchi M.C. 72 was an experimental seaplane designed and built by the Italian aircraft company Macchi Aeronautica. The M.C. 72 was built in 1931 with the idea of competing for what turned out to be the final Schneider Trophy race, but due to engine problems, the M.C. 72 was unable to compete. For two years, the M.C. 72 suffered from many mechanical defects, as well as the loss of two test pilots who died trying to coax world class speed out of the M.C. 72. After 35 flights, the engines were overhauled in preparation for a record attempt. The aircraft finally lived up to expectations when it set a new world speed record on 10 April 1933, with a speed of 682 km/h. Not satisfied, development continued as the aircraft's designers thought they could break 700 km/h with the M.C. 72. This feat was in fact achieved on 23 October 1934, when Agello piloted the M.C. 72 for an average speed of 709 km/h over three passes. The M.C. 72 held the world speed record for all aircraft for five years and remained the fastest speed ever attained by a piston-engine seaplane - until today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202047;A Visit in Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202047;In $YEAR$, the Emperor and the Empress of Austria visited Venice. The city was still aware of its lost independence, and nationalistic movements were around. In fact, the windows were locked and the streets empty. The Serenissima prepared a cold reception. Franz Josef mentioned later, that the silence 'killed more than a bullet'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202048;St Mark's Campanile;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202048;St Mark's Campanile (Campanile di San Marco in Italian) is the bell tower of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, located in the Piazza San Marco. It is one of the most recognizable symbols of the city. In July 1902, the north wall of the tower began to show signs of a dangerous crack that in the following days continued to grow. Finally, on Monday, July 14, around 9:45 am, the campanile collapsed completely, also demolishing the logetta. Remarkably, no one was killed, except for the caretaker's cat. Because of the campanile's position, the resulting damage was relatively limited. Apart from the logetta, only a corner of the Biblioteca Marciana was destroyed. The pietra del bando, a large porphyry column from which laws used to be read, protected the basilica itself. Nevertheless, the loss of one of the greatest symbols of old Italian culture was discuessed in the whole nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202049;The Death of Leopardi;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202049;Giacomo Leopardi was an Italian poet, essayist, philosopher, and philologist. Although he lived in a secluded town in the ultra-conservative Papal States, he came in touch with the main thoughts of the Enlightenment, and, by his own literary evolution, created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era. Leopardi often wrote about poetry in general and about his own idea of poetry, of its language and scope. Many pages on this subject can be found in the Zibaldone, a private diary and collection of notes, literary projects, translations, etc. Together with Alessandro Manzoni, Leopardi hat an immense impact on the Italian language and was one figurehead of patriotic and nationalistic movements in Italy. The greatest poet of Italian Romanticism died at 38 years in Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202050;Giosuè Carducci;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202050;Giosuè Carducci, born 1835 in Valdicastello (Lucca), was an Italian poet and teacher. He was very influential and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy, being a part of the general cultural and political life. Carducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. His political views were consistently opposed to Christianity generally and the secular power of the Catholic Church in particular. This anti-clerical revolutionary zeal is prominently showcased in one famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative 'Inno a Satana' (Hymn to Satan). While 'Inno a Satana' had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci's finest poetry came in later years. His collections Rime Nuove (New Rhymes) and Odi Barbare (Barbarian Odes) contain his greatest works.  Carducci also translated some works  of Goethe and Heine into Italian. One year before his death, Carducci became the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202051;Pascoli: La grande proletaria si è mossa!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202051;Giovanni Pascoli was an Italian poet and classical scholar. He studied at the University of Bologna, where his teacher and mentor was Giosuè Carducci. Pascoli, even in a period of Positivism and scientism, believed that life is a mystery. Only symbolic associations discovered in the humble things of nature can lead man to catch a glimpse of the truth behind mere appearances. His later poems share similar themes but are more experimental, and reflect his knowledge of classical antiquity. They were a great influence on later Italian poets, who incorporated his melancholy themes into their own works. He wrote in both Italian and Latin, he also translated English poetry. Pascoli was also a political activist, sympathising with Socialism. In $YEAR$, when the War of Libia broke out, he assumed a prominent role in the public debate. Pascoli's interventionist politicis were not unique in Italian intellectual circles: his rhetoric helped to shape the public mind and to create feelings of patriotism, of fraternal pride and of a shared destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202052;Gabriele D'Annunzio;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202052;Gabriele D'Annunzio was an Italian writer, poet, journalist, playwright and soldier. He occupied a prominent place in Italian literature and political life. He was nicknamed Il Vate (The Poet) and Il Profeta (The Prophet). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French Symbolism and British Aestheticism. At the height of his success, D'Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing and his work had immense impact across Europe and on generations of Italian writers. He came under the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche which would find outlets in his literary and later political contributions. In 1897 D'Annunzio was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he sat as an independent. He collaborated with Debussy, Mascagni, Marinetti and took a flight with Wilbur Wright, becoming a pilot himself and a hero in air-battles. Not only D'Annunzio himself, but also his contemporaries viewed him as Nietzschean 'Superman'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202053;La Conoscienza di Svevo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202053;Aron Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo, was an Italian writer and businessman. Italo Svevo (literally Italian Swabian) wrote the classic novel La Coscienza di Zeno (Confessions of Zeno, or Zeno's Conscience) and self-published it in 1923. The work, showing the author's interest in the theories of Sigmund Freud, is written in the form of the memoirs of one Zeno Cosini, who writes them at the insistence of his psychoanalyst. Schmitz's novel received almost no attention from Italian readers and critics at the time. The work might have disappeared altogether if it were not for the efforts of James Joyce. Joyce had met Svevo in 1907, when Joyce tutored him in English while working for Berlitz in Trieste. Joyce championed Confessions of Zeno, helping to have it translated into French and then published in Paris, where critics praised it extravagantly. That led Italian critics to discover it. Svevo was also a model for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Joyce's Ulysses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202054;Gioachino Rossini;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202054;Gioachino Antonio Rossini was an Italian composer who wrote 39 operas as well as sacred music, chamber music, songs, and some instrumental and piano pieces. His best-known operas include the Italian comedies Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville) and La Cenerentola and the French-language epics Moïse et Pharaon and Guillaume Tell. A tendency for inspired, song-like melodies is evident throughout his scores, which led to the nickname 'The Italian Mozart'.  Until his retirement in 1829, Rossini had been the most popular opera composer in history. He returned to the Papal States, namely Bologna, where he became dircetor of music, spending his time by composing chamber and sacred music.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202055;Donizetti's Caterina Cornaro;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202055;Gaetano Donizetti was an Italian composer from Bergamo, Lombardy. Along with Vincenzo Bellini and Gioachino Rossini, he was a leading composer of bel canto opera. Following the success of Linda di Chamounix, Caterina Cornaro was commissioned by Bartolomeo Merelli, impresario of the Kaertnerthortheater in Vienna, and was partly composed in 1842/1843. The Viennese realised that the same subject had been set to music the preceding year by Franz Lachner and the debut was cancelled. Two months after the triumph of Dom Sébastien in Paris, Caterina was booed at the San Carlo in Naples. The composer, who had been unable to be present at rehearsals or to oversee the orchestration, had clearly predicted the opera's failure: 'I am anxiously awaiting news of the fiasco of Caterina Cornaro in Naples. La Goldberg as a primadonna is my first disaster without knowing it. I wrote for a soprano, they give me a mezzo! God knows if Coletti, if Fraschini intend their roles as I intend them. God knows what a catastrophe censorship has brought.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202056;Cavalleria rusticana;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202056;Cavalleria rusticana (Rustic Chivalry), is an opera in one act by Pietro Mascagni to an Italian libretto by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti and Guido Menasci, and considered one of the classic verismo operas. Although Mascagni had started writing two other operas earlier (Pinotta, premiered in 1932 and Guglielmo Ratcliff, premiered in 1895), Cavalleria rusticana was his first opera to be completed and performed. \n\nIt remains the best known of his fifteen operas and one operetta. Its success has been phenomenal from its first performance in the Teatro Costanzi in Rome until the present day. At the time of Mascagni's death in 1945, the opera had been performed more than 14,000 times in Italy alone. The first performance of Cavalleria rusticana caused a sensation, with Mascagni taking 40 curtain calls on the opening night, and winning the First Prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202057;Fountains of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202057;Ottorino Respighi was an Italian composer, musicologist and conductor. His musicological interest in 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century music led him to also compose pieces based on the music of this period. He also wrote a number of operas, the best known being La fiamma. \n\nHe is best known for his orchestral 'Roman trilogy': Fountains of Rome (Le fontane di Roma), Pines of Rome (I pini di Roma), and Roman Festivals (Feste romane). Fountains of Rome is a sinfonic poem, seperated in four sections, depicting one of Rome's fountains during different periods of the day and night. Although the premiere in Rome was unsuccessful, Arturo Toscanini finally conducted the work in Milan in 1918 with tremendous success.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202058;Nessun Dorma;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202058;Giacomo Puccini, considered the greatest Italian composers of opera after Giuseppe Verdi, his operas were among the most frequently performed in the standard repertoire. While his early work was rooted in traditional late-19th century romantic Italian opera, he successfully developed his work in the 'realistic' verismo style, of which he became one of the leading exponents. Turandot, Puccini's final opera, was left unfinished, and the last two scenes were completed by Franco Alfano based on the composer's sketches. The libretto for Turandot was based on a play by Carlo Gozzi, also called Turandot. The music of the opera is heavily inflected with pentatonic motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavor to the music. Unlike La Fanciulla, Turandot contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them Nessun dorma. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202059;Aida;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202059;Aida, sometimes spelled Aïda, is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, based on a scenario often attributed to French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette. Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, commissioned Verdi to write the opera for the performance in January $YEAR$, paying him 150,000 francs. \n\nAlthough the premiere was delayed, Aida met with great acclaim when it finally opened in Cairo on 24 December $YEAR$. Auguste Mariette designed the costumes and accessories and oversaw the design and construction of the sets, which were created in and shipped from Paris for the premiere. Although Verdi did not attend the premiere, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian premiere, held at La Scala, Milan, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC202061;Rigoletto is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi. The Italian libretto was written on the play Le roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo. It was first performed at La Fenice in Venice in $YEAR$. Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere. \n\nIt is considered by many to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career, being the first of his three 'Popular' operas (Il Trovatore and La Traviata conclude the trilogy). Rigoletto premiered to a sold out La Fenice and was a complete triumph, especially the scena drammatica, and the Duke's cynical aria, 'La donna è mobile' which was sung in the streets the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME202063;The Requiem;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202063;On $MONTH$, $YEAR$, the Italian writer and humanist Alessandro Manzoni, whom Verdi had admired all his adult life and met in 1868, died. Upon hearing of his death, Verdi resolved to complete a Requiem for the most important Italian writer of the 19th century. The Requiem was first performed in the church of San Marco in Milan and three days later at the Scala, conducted by Verdi himself. It won immediate contemporary success, and became a national celebration of arts, as two of the greatest cultural personalities of Italy - one in the field of music, one in the field of literature - merged together in an allegory of artistic spirit. As to the music qua music, the critical consensus agreed that the work displayed 'fluent invention, beautiful sound effects and charming vocal writing.' Critics were divided between praise and condemnation with respect to Verdis willingness to break standard compositional rules for musical effect, such as his use of consecutive fifths.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME202065;Restaurazione;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC202065;Following the defeat of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna (1815) convened to redraw Europe. In Italy, the Congress restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments, either directly ruled or strongly influenced by the prevailing powers, particularly Austria. Since the Habsburgs controlled the predominantly Italian-speaking northeastern part of present-day Italy, it expectedly was the most powerful force against Italian unification. The Habsburgs vigorously repressed nationalist sentiment growing on the Italian peninsula, as well as in the other parts of their domains. \n\nKlemens von Metternich, an influential Austrian diplomat stated that the word Italy was nothing more than 'a geographic expression'. However, Italian artistic and literary sentiment nevertheless turned towards nationalism, provoking a climate, in which the Resurgence of Italy would occur: The Risorgimento.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
