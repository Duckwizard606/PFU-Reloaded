;;;;;;;;;;;;x;EVTNAME500000;The Organic Statute of Poland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EVTDESC500000;The Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland was a Statute which replaced the Constitution of 1815 in the aftermath of the failed November Uprising in the Russian Partition. The Statute was pronounced in occupied Warsaw on March 1832 by Marshal Ivan Fyodorovich Paskevich, who named himself a namestnik. The Statute, signed by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, replaced the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Russian Empire with the "eternal incorporation" of Poland into Russia. The Parliament of the Kingdom was abolished, and its army merged with the Russian Army. \n §RNOTE: Congress Poland is an extremely hard to play substate. You won't get any soldiers and when the Polish Uprising begins you will probably lose the game.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EVTOPT500000A;When will the Poles be free?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EVTNAME500001;The Polish Uprising of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EVTDESC500001;After the latest war our subjects in Poland and other parts of our empire began to grow restless. The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army. It was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. In Warsaw alone 116 demonstrations were held in $YEAR$. Much of these manifestations in ended in clashes with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Army. In spite of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police interference, a symbolic meeting of hymn-singing Poles and Lithuanians took place on the bridge across an important River. The crowds sang "God protect Poland" in Lithuanian and Belarusian. Earlier in $YEAR$ the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government introduced a state of emergency in Kovno and Grodno as well as several other Polish-majority provinces. Public gatherings were banned and some public leaders were declared outlaws.
